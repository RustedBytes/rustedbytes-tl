# `astral-tl`

tl is a fast HTML parser written in pure Rust.

By default this crate builds without `std` or `alloc`. Enable `std` for the
allocating convenience API:

```toml
astral-tl = { version = "0.1", features = ["std"] }
```

For the nightly portable SIMD path, enable `portable-simd` and build with
nightly:

```sh
cargo +nightly build --features portable-simd
```
